# Hanipeg

Hanipeg is a creative hub focused on building tools around FFmpeg and other multimedia processing tools. Our mission is to simplify the world of video and audio editing, making it more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.

## What We Do

At Hanipeg, we specialize in crafting tools that harness the power of FFmpeg and other multimedia processing tools. Currently, we are in the process of building a scripting language designed to streamline video editing and audio manipulation. We believe in providing users with intuitive solutions that empower them to express their creativity without the complexities often associated with multimedia processing.

## Getting Involved

We are actively developing our scripting language, and contributions from the community are welcome! If you're passionate about multimedia processing and want to contribute to making video and audio editing more accessible, check out our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hanipeg).
